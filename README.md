A tic-tac-toe inspired game created for a lab in the information systems master program at Uppsala university.


The game is a stacked tic-tac-toe with up to 2 levels. A player has to win three "small" boards each containing 
a tic-tac-toe to win the "large" board that contains the small boards.

A single command line argument provides the coordinates for each player move, where Player X starts and the following coordinates alternate between Player X and Player O. 
However, only valid moves i.e. not pointing to a tile already played or a small board already won is accepted, 
otherwise we assume that the next move in the list of coordinates belongs to the player in question since the first move was rejected.

Example input: `Lab3.exe "NW.CC, NC.CC, NW.NW, NE.CC, NW.SE, CE.CC, CW.CC, SE.CC, CW.NW, CC.CC, CW.SE, CC.NW, CC.SE, CE.NW, SW.CC, CE.SE, SW.NW, SE.SE, SW.SE"`

A scoreboard is printed at the end of the game, showing a list of winning large boards, list of winning small boards in the order in which they were played 
and a comma separated value denoting how many games player X has won while the second value denotes that of player O. Each value contains number of large and small board wins separated with a dot.

Example output:

<pre>NW, CW, SW<br>NW.CC, NW.NW, NW.SE, CW.CC, CW.NW, CW.SE, SW.CC, SW.NW, SW.SE<br>1.3, 0.1</pre>
